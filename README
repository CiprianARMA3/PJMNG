**The AI-Powered Operating System for Software Teams.**

Kapry.dev is a next-generation project management platform built specifically for developers. It seamlessly blends traditional agile tools with a suite of context-aware AI agents—powered by Google Gemini—to accelerate development, automate code reviews, and simplify database architecture.

## 🌟 Why Kapry.dev?

Modern software development requires more than just moving tickets across a board. It requires deep context, code intelligence, and automated insights. Kapry.dev bridges the gap between your **Project Management** (Kanban, Roadmaps) and your **Codebase** (GitHub, SQL, Logic).

### 🤖 The AI Suite (Gemini 2.5/3.0)
* **AI Code Review:** Connects deeply with your GitHub repositories to perform security audits, architectural reviews, and code quality checks on entire file trees.
* **SQL Architect:** A natural-language-to-SQL engine that generates complex queries and visualizes schema changes before you run them.
* **Roadmap Visualizer:** Turns scattered ideas into structured, Markdown-based technical roadmaps, identifying critical paths and dependencies automatically.
* **Context-Aware Assistant:** A coding partner that understands your specific project context, tech stack, and documentation.

### 🛠 Project Management Core
* **Interactive Kanban:** Drag-and-drop task management with custom columns, tags, and issue linking.
* **Dev Calendar:** specialized timeline view for sprint planning and release cycles.
* **Deep Analytics:** GitHub-style contribution heatmaps, velocity tracking, and issue distribution charts.
* **Activity Logs:** comprehensive audit trails of every action, commit, and AI interaction within the workspace.
